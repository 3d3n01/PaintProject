Objective:
To create a simple paint program.

Procedure:
Write a simple paint program. The user should be able to select shape, shape’s position, size and color.  You should be able to input some of these values by using text boxes. Use shapes to make drawings.
Add at least one function where you can drag the mouse and interactively either draw or move objects.
